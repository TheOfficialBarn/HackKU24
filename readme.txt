I got it to work Yupi.
The code isn't forked anymore so this is the same repository as the one I am working on, which simplifies the workflow a bunch.

When you make changes they are automatically added to the log that you can "commit". This commit will go to the FoshBranch.

If you want to finalize what you did in FoshBranch, you have to merge it to the main/master branch. This serves as the final hub pretty much.
