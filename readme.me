This project was created in order to promote good hygiene practices daily. The app is supposed to motivate those who struggle
in a fun, game-like way. The calendar ideally displays the days you've completed your tasks. The Missions tab gives you the
opportunity to check them off. Lastly, Home allows you to see your current streak and increment it. There is no reset in order to
really solidify the fact that hygiene is a must that should be performed daily, therefore there is no reason that it should ever
reset. In fact, the streak is essentially just how long you've had this silly app downloaded for is you dared to install it.

Enjoy Bound 2 Clean from the Dev Team!
